This project aims to develop a credit card fraud prediction system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can effectively identify and flag potential instances of credit card fraud based on historical transaction data.


A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and payments. Though the Credit cards can be a convenient way to manage your finances, they can also be risky. Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of someone else's credit card or credit card information to make purchases or withdraw cash.

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
